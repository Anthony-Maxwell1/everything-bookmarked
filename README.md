# Everything Bookmarked
## What!?
I am on a mission to make as many tools as I can in the bookmarks bar.
## What has Everything Bookmarked done so far?
As of now I only have EditMark available, which allows you to edit any website. There are several tools, and EditMark is located in a different repo.
I am currently working on MusicMark, which allows you to play music by pressing a button. There's even a fully fledged audio player!
